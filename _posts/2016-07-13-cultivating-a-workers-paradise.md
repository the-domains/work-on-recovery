  In 1984 a disillusioned Spanish psychologist named Cristóbal Colón drove his
  Citroën 2CV through a high-canopied Catalan forest called La Fageda d'en
  Jordà. Colón had walked through this airy, enchanted forest with his Bouvier
  des Flandres cattle dogs many times, but now he was on his way to buy a farm.
