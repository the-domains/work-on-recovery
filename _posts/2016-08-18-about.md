About

The Work on Recovery site comprises the research blog of a PhD candidate in Human Geography studying at the University of Glasgow. My research attempts to scrutinize the term 'work' and considers how working has an impact upon recovery for individuals living with severe and enduring mental ill-health. Posts from other blogs, think-tanks, third sector and governmental organisations are shared and commented upon, as well as original blog posts from time to time.
