      U.S. businesses suffer more than $225 billion in losses each year due to
      absent and sick workers. It makes sense, then, that most U.S. employers
      have come to embrace the idea that a healthy workforce is good for the
      bottom line - almost 80 percent of all organizations with 50 or more
      staffers offer some kind of workplace wellness program.

  Recently, the government's Fit For Work (FFW) service tweeted, 'For 300,000
  people, sickness can result in a complete end to employment & dramatic loss of
  earnings' This seemed a welcome acceptance of the reality of how ill health
  affects employment, in contrast to the government's usual portrayal of people
  on sickness and disability benefits having made a lifestyle choice.
